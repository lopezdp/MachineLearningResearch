### Background
Digital Currencies have led to an evolution in how society thinks about the abstract concept of money. This paradigm shift in the recording of transactions, and what it means to make a transaction with a secure store of value in a digital economy riddled with persistent threats against the frictionless flow of digital payments, is what we as the authors of this research, are attempting to quantify in order to better understand why and how a digital currencies like Bitcoin, obtains the astronomical inherent values that society has observed. 

### Objectives
The objective is to leverage the Python programming language and Open Source Machine Learning Libraries like Google's TensorFlow, to find features within a specific data set related to Bitcoin and other correlating asset classes, to build a model using linear regression techniques to find a feature(s) that has/have a high degree of impact on the price of Bitcoin.

### Methods
Implement a Linear Regression Model to fit weighted features against a bias to determine the outcome of a label or target, in this case, the price of Bitcoin.

After the implementation of the model in Seaborn, statsmodels, and TensorFlow, we will implement tests against each feature to determine which feature, or predictor, will have the highest degree of statistical significance in terms of its impact on the price of Bitcoin to conclude any future outcomes that **may** occur under changing market conditions.

### Results
Pending

### Conclusions
Pending

### Limitations
* Google Trends data is only available as Monthly data over longer time horizons. This research includes a method to programmatically normalize the trend data into Daily data points to better compare it against Daily price data and other features used in the model presented.

* There does not appear to be many inversely correlated features to the price of Bitcoin. This may indicate that some other unobserved/unknown variable is having an impact on all asset classes as investors search for higher yields in an inflationary economic environment.
