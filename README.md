## Tools, Frameworks, & Methodology

The goal of the projects stored in this directory is to explore all of the tools and resources available to Machine Learning & Ai engineers in order to better hone the skills needed to become a better engineer. It is my intention to apply mathematical insight and understanding with these tools to predict probable outcomes from the features defined in these projects in order to gain a better understanding of the digital world.

A few of the tools applied to the research in this repository include, but are not limited to the following:

* Numpy, Scipy: **Data Computation**
* Pandas: **import/export, data manipulation, filtering, & resizing**
* Matplotlib, seaborn: **Data visualization**
* Sklearn, Tensorflow: **Machine Learning Need x64 Python3 install for ML**
* TF, theano, keras: **Deep Learning**
* NLTK, Textblob: **Natural Language Processing**
* Opencv, skimage: **Image Processing**

All worked performed in **Jupyter Lab**.
